In a conversation yesterday where I complained about not being able to find time to write about all of the design books I own, [Greg Borenstein](http://gregborenstein.com/) suggested that I should start blogging about them. That seemed like a good idea, so I'm going to try to accumulate a small catalog of my books by writing at least a post a week, posting pictures and short descriptions about the collection that has taken me many years to assemble.

As I cannot live without constraints, I'm going to limit every post to 3 pictures and 3 smaller paragraphs. This picture shows about 1/10 of my books, so there's some way to go.
