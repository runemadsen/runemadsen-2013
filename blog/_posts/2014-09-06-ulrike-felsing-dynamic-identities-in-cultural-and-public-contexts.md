Last week's posts about Karl Gerstner reminded me of this book. *Dynamic Identities in Cultural and Public Contexts* (2010) is less of a design book, and more of an academic research paper on dynamic logo design, in which the author categorizes the different qualities of computational and generative identities.

I see a clear line to Karl Gerstner's work on modular design systems, and many of his design products could have been featured in this book. Although the book has many real-world design examples, I find the quality of them a bit lacking. This could be because the field of generative design often leans more towards trends and technical ambitions than actual good design. I show some of that work in my lecture on [dynamic logos](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-logo/) (although that link mostly has notes for myself).

One of the more interesting logos in the book is the visual identity for Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. I had the chance to see it in person during last year's [Eyeo Festival](http://eyeofestival.com/), and it's quite interesting. The logo is built around the custom *Walker* typeface created for the center in 1995, and a custom piece of software that generates these word collages. Every character in the alphabet is mapped to a word (*d* is *design*, *e* is *exhibitions*, etc), and a new visual can quickly be generated by pressing a few keys on a keyboard. The horizontal structure of the identity is also perfect for leading visitors through the hallways of the building.

In a field where critical thinking is often neglected (*"Hey look, I splattered a canvas with an algorithm!*"), I welcome this book with open arms.
