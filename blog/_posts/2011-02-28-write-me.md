Times are super busy right now, so I'll just want to post this image of the latest project I did with Amy and Christine from ITP. It's a video sculpture programmed in <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc" target="_blank">Open Frameworks</a> where people can leave a drawing using a tablet, and the sculpture plays back the drawings from the collective pool of all past visitors. As soon as my schedule clears I'll do a bigger write up in the portfolio section of this site.
