This post describe(måske et bedre ord end decribe. fx. address) something I see as a continuing trend in the design world: T(dobbelttjek om det skal være med stort) he rise of the meta-designer and algorithmic design systems.

> "Meta-design is much more difficult than design; it’s easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it" - Donald Knuth, The Metafont Book

Until recently, the term *Graphic Designer* was used to describe artists firmly rooted in the fine arts. Aspiring design students graduated with MFA degrees, and their curriculums were based on traditions taught by painting, sculpture and architecture: The concepts of form, color and composition were introduced through manual exercises, and Paul Rand once famously said: *"It's important to use your hands. This is what distinguishes you from a cow or a computer operator"*. At best, this teaches designers not to be dictated by their given tool. At worst, designers are institutionalized to think of themselves as ideators: the direct opposite to a technical person. 

This has obviously changed with the advent of computers (and the field of web design in particular), but not to the degree that one would expect. Despite recent efforts in defining digital-first design vocabularies, like [Google's Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), the legacy of the printed page is still omniscient. Even the most adept companies are organized around principles inherited from desktop publishing, and when the lines are drawn, we still have either design or engineering departments. Products start as static layouts in the former and become dynamic implementations in the latter. Designers use tools modeled after manual processes that came way before the computer, while engineers work in purely text-based environments. I believe this approach to design will change in a fundamental way, and like Donald Knuth, I call this the transition from design to meta-design.

So what is meta-design? In a traditional design practice, the designer works directly on a design product. Be it a logo, website, or a set of posters, the designer is the instrument to produce the final artifact. A meta-designer works to distill this instrumentation into a design system, often written in software, that can create the final artifact. Instead of drawing it (her synes jeg du skal indsætte 'e.g. by hand'), she is programming the system to draw it. These systems can then be used within different contexts to generate a range of design products without much effort.

As a simple example, consider these logos for two concert halls in Portugal. The logo on the left is a classic, static design product. On the right is 4 variations of a logo designed by [Sagmeister & Walsh](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/). It was generated by logo software written specifically for the concert hall, which can be used to [generate endless variations of the logo](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/casa-da-musica-identity/), for use in posters, business cards, and on the web.

I believe this to be an important evolution in the design profession, and there are several factors that has lead me to this conclusion.

    <strong>Design products are becoming increasingly dynamic</strong>, which makes it difficult to sustain a design process based on static prototypes. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs">Design is how it works</a>, so sketching in code is the only natural way to prototype a dynamic system. Building even the simplest of data visualizations means hours of work in languages like R, Julia or Python. When your content is data, poking around in Photoshop simply makes no sense. In some way, it's the direct opposite of design: prettifying without context. Visual thinking is increasingly done in code, and there is not much to do if you can't program. As our design products become dynamic, it makes less and less sense to separate the design and implementation.

    <strong>A new generation of designers</strong> is starting to occupy important design positions in the U.S and abroad. For these designers, programming is a natural tool for creating the design products they desire, and their creative process is often built on a very systematic approach to design. They are as visually talented as technical proficient, and they see the technical process as an accelerator for creativity, as well as a way to liberate themselves from the manual techniques enforced upon them from traditional design software. Therefore, they often struggle to work in environments that enforce a traditional division of labor.

    <strong>An expanding set of algorithmic design tools</strong> now provide a better level of entry for many aspiring designers, who wouldn't ordinarily think of themselves as programmers. Even though IDE's for system designers are still suprisingly few and lacking in features (an argument fit for a blog post in itself), there are now hundreds of libraries and frameworks for creating designs in code. We're also seeing a proliferation of educational material aimed at visual thinkers. Recent publications for just a single one of these projects, <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Processing-Programming-Handbook-Designers-Artists/dp/026202828X/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406934187&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=processing">books</a>, <a href="http://icm.shiffman.net/0.0/">videos</a>, <a href="http://natureofcode.com/book">websites</a>, and <a href="http://hello.processing.org/">interactive learning environments</a>, most of them freely accessible on the internet.

    <strong>Systems are an important part of our design history</strong>. I find this point extremely important, as it's something I realized rather late in my design education. Even though design can seem like a very subjective profession, the fundamentals of design are not, and <a href="http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-intro/">the history of graphic design is full of artists using rules or systems</a> in their creative process. Even before the computer was a household item, Karl Gerstner wrote a book called <em><a href="http://runemadsen.com/blog/karl-gerstner-designing-programmes/">"Designing Programmes"</a></em>, outlining many of these exact ideas. Algorists like Sol Lewitt also valued the algorithm over the artifact. Today these theories can be more than theoretical instructions for a manual workflow. We have the ability to write algorithmic systems that create designs, and the designer of the future will need to understand how to deliver on that promise.

It is dangerous to speculate about simplistic futures, and I'm convinced that  traditional design practices will be even more relevant as time goes by. However, I think we'll see implications to both professional practices and educational institutions: A new type of design program, oriented towards meta-designers, will spring (nutid i stedet for fremtid. Det er allerede startet). from within technically literate institutions. A new of type meta-design practice will become increasingly visible. These companies will be able to deliver everything from basic identity design to complex systems, making them ideal partners for forward-looking companies. [Design studios](sagmeisterwalsh.com) are actively exploring similar themes. Academic institutions are focusing on dynamic design products in [new publications](http://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Identities-Cultural-Public-Context/dp/3037781637). Independent [design](http://www.dot-dot-dot.us/) [magazines](http://www.servinglibrary.org/) are also writing about these trends. There's a few indicators that this future is already here.
