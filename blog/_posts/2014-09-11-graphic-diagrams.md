Lately I've been writing about data visualization and its connection to our broader graphic design history. This reminded me of this book, *Graphis Diagrams*, first published in 1974. To put things in perspective, this was 7 years before the release of the [Xerox Star computer](https://www.google.com/search?q=polaroids+xerox+star&espv=2&biw=1252&bih=802&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=6OgRVJDdGfeJsQTty4GwDw&ved=0CB0QsAQ), which pretty much defined the way we think of modern day computers and their interfaces.

When I need to show how data visualization doesn't exist in a vacuum, this is the book I bring. It's a great testament to how our modern design trends are a natural evolution of a graphic design expression that has existed for many decades. There is too many things to say about this book, but this is my general conclusion: the market for data visualization books is vast and terrible. I own at least 5 books about data design published after 2005 that I bring to lectures to show bad practices. The biggest flaw in them seems to be a blind fascination of the computer as a design tool, and the way to avoid this might be to read a book where many of the designs were made without a computer.

[Browsing the book](https://www.google.com/search?q=graphis+diagrams&espv=2&biw=1252&bih=802&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=3u0RVOP3JfDGsQSdnICYBg&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ), you'll discover work with similarities to many modern design products, and I often look to this book for inspiration too. The book itself is quite expensive, but I've found that most university libraries have one in stock.
