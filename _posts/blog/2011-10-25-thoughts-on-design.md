It's been so long since I've posted anything on the blog. My schedule has been packed with graduating from ITP, starting work as an interactive developer at the New York Times, and working at ITP as a resident researcher.

I thought I'd post these slides from a workshop I gave today about how to think about design in digital media. I'm hoping to expand them into a series of tutorials (hopefully on my re-designed website after Christmas), but until now this will have to do.

You can <a href="http://runemadsen.s3.amazonaws.com/slides/thoughtsondesign.pdf">download the slides as a PDF</a> here.
