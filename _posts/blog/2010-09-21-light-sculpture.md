This video shows a light sculpture I built with Peter Holzkorn and Don Miller. The idea was to create a sculpture that uses light as the primary medium of communication. We created the sculpture with 4 long light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. The lights turns on and off in patterns, showing the almost flaming glow from each bulb when lit up. The idea behind the pattern was this: A digital byte consists of 8 bit, that is eight zero's or one's. The Arduino controlling the bulbs is converting a single letter from the alphabet at a time into an ASCII number and signaling this number in a 2-step sequence (a half byte at a time). This creates a continuous light pattern with similarities to morse code.
