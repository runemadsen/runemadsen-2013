excerpt: |
  A common phrase in any metropolis is the term "people watching." By creating sidewalk barricades made up by home-made cardboard cones and yellow stick tape, people are challenged to either adapt to or defy this unofficial element on street. This project was a collaboration with Scott Wayne Indiana, Nik Psaroudakis, and Nien Lam.
