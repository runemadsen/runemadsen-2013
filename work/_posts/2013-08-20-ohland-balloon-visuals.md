The Balloon Projections is a set of interactive visuals made for the Danish musician [Oh Land](http://www.ohlandmusic.com). During live performances the balloons interact with specific parts of the music, that being projected heads singing background vocals or blinking lights triggered by the drums. The result is a real-time interaction between the musicians in Oh Land and their background visuals.

The central part of the Ballon Projections is a custom piece of software written in C++ and the open source visual framework [OpenFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc). The software includes an interactive plotter to record the position of the ballons, a MIDI listener that receives notes from the musicians, and a visual playlist loader that makes it easy to map specific songs to specific visual outputs.

This project is a collaboration with [Paul Rothman](http://www.fridgebuzzz.com/).
