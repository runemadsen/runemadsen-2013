[O'Reilly Atlas](https://atlas.oreilly.com) is a web application aimed at simplifying the creation and distribution of digital content. It is a Git-backed writing and production tool that exports books as PDF, ePub, Mobi and HTML, from single source Markdown, Asciidoc or HTML files, styled with CSS only.

<div class="wide-750">
  <img src="{% asset_path work/atlas.jpg %}" />
</div>

All features in the application can either be used through the UI, or through an extensive API that allows publishers to use Atlas as a part of their native toolchain.
      
A closer look at the app architecture and workflow can be found in [this excellent blog post by Sanders Kleinfeld](http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2014/next-generation-book-publishing-of-the-html-by-the-html-for-the-html/), or via the [splash page of the application itself](https://atlas.oreilly.com).
