Spare some change for a Machinosh Classic? "I Used To Be Somebody" is a comment on our consumption of technology. The video features an old Machintosh Classic 2 standing outside the Apple Store. Equipped with a face-tracking webcam in the floppy drive it's desperatly looking at people passing by, asking for spare change to survive.

This project is inspired by [JED's Other Poem](http://stewd.io/w/jed) by [Stewart Smith](http://stewd.io) and is a collaboration with [Scott Wayne Indiana](http://www.39forks.com).
